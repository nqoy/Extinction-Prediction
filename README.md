**Can we predict the extintion of species?**  

The process of getting the answer is built on several stages which are executed by algorithmic functions in Python:  

🌱 **_Getting The Data_** - Crawling and scrapping a data filled web-site.
🔭 **_Data Handling_** - Cleaning currupt vlaues and filling missing data.
⚡ **_Visualization And Analyzation_** - Visualizing the data for a clearer way to analyze and show corraletions between its properties.
:computer: **_Machine Learning_** - Creating a trained model which takes the data and predicts if a species will get extinct or not.
